# Network Intrusion Detection System
Welcome to the Network Intrusion Detection System project! This project aims to automate the management and handling of network attacks using machine learning techniques. With a dataset of over 10,000 network logs, we led the data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering phases. Our efforts culminated in the development and evaluation of machine learning models, with Random Forest emerging as the most effective model, achieving an accuracy of 98%. Additionally, we utilized Power BI for data analysis and visualization, enhancing our insights.
