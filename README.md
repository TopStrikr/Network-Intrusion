# Network-Intrusion
Network Intrusion Detection System
The Network Intrusion Detection System is aimed at automating the management and handling of network attacks. Working with a dataset of over 10,000 network logs, I led the data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering phases. Following this, we developed and evaluated machine learning models, with Random Forest emerging as the most effective model, achieving an accuracy of 98%. Additionally, we utilized Power BI for data analysis and visualization, enhancing our insights.
